## Notes

- You have the option of either having logos or text in the featured links (i.e., the linkedin, github, etc. links that show up just beneath the intro section). The components are `FeaturedLinkLogo` and `FeaturedLinkText` respectively, and use the `list-fill.tsx` file to map out the links.
